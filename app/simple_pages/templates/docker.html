    <h2>Containers</h2>
    <p>A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. In simpler terms, it is a sandboxed process on your machine that is isolated from all other processes on the host machine.</p>
    <h2>Images</h2>
    <p>A Docker image is a read-only template that contains a set of instructions for creating a container that can run on the Docker platform. It provides a convenient way to package up applications and preconfigured server environments, which you can use for your own private use or share publicly with other users who use Docker.</p>
