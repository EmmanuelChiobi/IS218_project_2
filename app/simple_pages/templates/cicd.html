    <h2>Continuous Delivery</h2>
    <p>Continuous delivery is the ability to get changes of all types (including new features, configuration changes, bug fixes and experiments) into production, or into the hands of users, safely and quickly is a sustainable way. It is a software development practice where code changes are automatically prepared for a release to production. It expands upon continuous integration by deploying all code changes to a testing environment and/or a production environment after the build stage. When this is properly implemented, developers will always have a deployment-ready build artifact that has passed through a standardized test process.</p>
    <h2>Continuous Integration</h2>
    <p>Continuous integration is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. It is a DevOps software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run. It most often refers to the build or integration stage of the software release process and entails both an automated component (e.g. a CI or build service) and a cultural component (e.g. learning to integrate frequently).</p>
    <h2>How CI/CD Is Used In Our Project</h2>
    <p>These practices play an integral role in the build development of our web application project. The two files in our project that are of the most importance for this responsibility are the "dev.yml" and "prod.yml" files in the ".github/workflows" directory. When edited, it should display the username and password of the developer's DockerHub account (which will enable the project to be built into a container) and the username & password of the developer's Heroku account as well as the developer's email for said account and the title of the app being used for each practice (either the app used for staging/development or the app used for production. With every new change committed, the changes are pushed into a new branch entitled "development" for the project's repository. A new pull request is created, and two tests are then conducted in order for the project to be transferred to the development app in Heroku for hosting. After the pull request is merged with the main branch (master), three most tests are conducted, this time in the production workflow, in order for the build to be hosted by Heroku from within the production app. After all of that, your web application should successfully be hosted within the development and production servers of Heroku.</p>
